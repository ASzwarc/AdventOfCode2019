# AdventOfCode2019
Solutions for Advent of Code 2019 (in Python) with notes, lessons learned, thoughts and frustrations...
I'm still working on solutions even though it's already January. My goal is to finish all challenges

__Day 11__

I wrote code with some debug prints and run it with provided input. Code was running for about 30 seconds and I've, incorrectly, assumed that code stuck in infinite loop. I spend half day debugging only to find out that code was correct I just had to wait longer... I'm too impatient...

__Lessons learned__:
- prints in Python are reeeealy slow, without them code runs 10x faster
- be patient...
